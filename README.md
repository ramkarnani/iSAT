iSAT - Interactive Stratified Attribute Tracking Diagram
iSAT is a representation which helps to explicate the migration patterns of the population across different phases. In each phase the observed attribute values are categorised to strata according to your set criteria. The distribution of each strata and the migration between phases are visualised. Through interaction the migration pattern can be highlighted.
